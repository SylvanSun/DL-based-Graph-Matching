# DL-based-Graph-Matching
Course project for AI3607, deep learning based graph matching with jittor as the deep learning framework.

## Important Notice
I only implemented the basic functions as required by the final project assignments.
During 2022-2023 Fall semester, the evaluation metrics of this course is pretty loose(with average score 55/60 for the final project), so you might want to resort to some of my classmates for reference of more complicated functions.
